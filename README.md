# Banking Data Visualizer

The Banking Data Visualizer is an application designed to provide users with a comprehensive view of their financial transactions.
The app's core features and vision include:

## Grouped Transactions

Display a list of all transactions for a specific month, grouped by beneficiary.
Allow users to switch between a monthly and yearly view with a simple click of a button.

## Transaction Details

When users click on a grouped entry by beneficiary, display all the transactions for the selected duration (month or year).
By default, transactions are sorted from newest to oldest, but users should be able to switch the sorting to be grouped by MandateReference.
Color-code the transactions based on their MandateReference for better visualization.

## Transaction Labeling

Enable users to select individual transactions and assign custom labels.
Provide an option to group transactions based on their assigned labels.
Offer a filtering system that allows users to create "filtered-labels" based on specific transaction properties, such as creditorID, mandateRef, or booking text using regex patterns.

## Data Analysis

Implement features to help users spot changes, trends, and anomalies in their financial transactions, allowing for better decision-making and insights.
By developing the Banking Data Visualizer with these goals in mind, we aim to create a user-friendly and powerful tool to assist users in managing and understanding their financial data.
